/*
Car yard has the attrs:
    capacity, code and cararray:
        cararray is an array of Car objects from the Car class

Car yard has behaviours:
    Default and parameterized constructors
    get_total_stock_count {returns number of cars in the yard}
    get_stock_quantity {returns number of cars with a code equal to the formal parameter passed in}
    get_current_stock_list {returns raw pointer to the car array}
    add_stock {adds a car to the car array if there is space}

Use:
    Car yard can be used to initialise a given array of car objects, can store their details based upon
    the get methods of the original car class
